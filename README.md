I am a Junior Software Engineer from Brazil and a Software Engineering student at FIAP. With a strong passion for backend development using the Java ecosystem, I am actively seeking an **international career opportunity** where I can apply my skills to build scalable and high-impact software solutions.

In my current role as a Junior Systems Analyst at SManager, I have gained hands-on experience with the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, configuring critical tools like AMQ Broker and Red Hat Data Grid in production environments. I also have solid experience with the Liferay DXP platform, where I've contributed to large-scale enterprise projects and honed my ability to solve complex technical challenges independently.
